I’ll likely reflect on how universal or adaptable these approaches really are.\nWhere possible, I will also consider some economic or financial implications of some methods or strategies discussed each week—especially in terms of how feasible they are in different contexts.\nOverall, my reflections will focus on remote sensing and its value for urban development, while trying to keep a neutral and critical perspective on its benefits and limitations."

    "section": "2.1 Introduction",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nI currently understand remote sensing as the process of gathering information about the Earth’s surface without direct contact. This is done through passive sensors (like satellite imagery) and active sensors (like LiDAR and RADAR). Passive sensors detect reflected sunlight, while active ones send out pulses (e.g., lasers) and measure what bounces back. Both rely on electromagnetic waves. Remote sensing is often combined with GIS to analyse landscapes, land cover, urban areas, and environmental change. The combination of these techniques, and the data they produce, enables environmental monitoring, resource management, and biodiversity conservation at different spatial scales. Figure 1 summarizes it all.\n\n\n\nFig.1 Overview of Remote Sensing\n\n\nWhat caught my attention this week was the role of satellites—these suspended systems orbiting Earth. Remote sensing and satellites go hand-in-hand, but I hadn’t really considered the different types before. There are:\nGeostationary satellites – stationary, mainly used for weather, telecoms, and large-scale monitoring. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites – used for high-resolution imaging, orbiting 160–2,000 km above Earth. Sun-synchronous (polar) satellites – orbit Earth in sync with the sun, useful for consistent scientific observations. The sun-synchronous satellites, especially Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, stood out to me because they’re both widely used in environmental monitoring. Here’s a brief comparison:\n\n\n\nFeature\nLandsat-8\nSentinel-2\n\n\n\n\nResolution\n30m\n10-60m\n\n\nRevisit Time\n16days\n5days\n\n\nBands\n11 bands\n13 bands\n\n\n\nA term that I think will keep coming up is bands. Bands are like filters for specific wavelengths of light. Each band captures data differently, and depending on which are available, a satellite may be better suited for certain tasks. For instance, near-infrared is good for vegetation monitoring, while shortwave infrared helps with detecting soil moisture. Looking at the image here (figure 2),\n\n\n\nFig. 2 Comparison of Landsat 7 and 8 bands with Sentinel-2\n\n\nI noticed that while both satellites share some bands, they also have unique ones. For example, Landsat-8 includes a Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) which Sentinel-2 lacks—this means Landsat can provide thermal data like land surface temperature (LST), which is valuable in urban heat studies.\nUnderstanding bands will be key in selecting the right satellite for different types of studies. It’s already helping me see how technical features link to practical applications."

    "section": "2.2 Application",
    "text": "2.2 Application\nFor this section, I wanted to use what I learned in the summary to figure out which satellite is more suitable for land cover classification. A study by Ahady, A.B. and Kaplan, G. compared Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data over the city of Kabul, focusing on classification accuracy across four land cover types: water, cropland, urban, and bare land.\nKey insights\n\nLandsat-8 had an overall classification accuracy 85.04%.\nSentinel-2 had a classification accuracy of 94.26%.\n\nLet’s look at the outputs:\n\n\n\nFig. 3 Landsat-8’s imagery\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 4 Sentinel-2 imagery\n\n\nFrom the images, it’s clear that Sentinel-2 (Figure 4) shows finer detail compared to Landsat-8 (Figure 3). One major reason could be the spatial resolution—Sentinel-2 has higher resolution, which allows it to define features more clearly, especially in urban and mixed-use areas. That likely contributes to its higher classification accuracy.\nAnother factor could be the revisit time. Sentinel-2 revisits every 5 days, while Landsat-8 takes 16 days. That means more cloud-free images are available from Sentinel-2 within the same time frame, which improves the chance of capturing clearer, more usable data.\nLastly, the spectral bands might also influence classification. As I noted earlier, bands are like filters that let satellites “see” certain land characteristics. The study used surface reflectance bands, and the near-infrared (NIR) band was especially important. For Landsat-8, that’s Band 5, and for Sentinel-2, it’s Band 8. NIR is key for separating vegetation from built-up areas, which makes it critical in land classification.\nThat said, I don’t think the study’s results mean Sentinel-2 is always better. One limitation might be the classification model used. Also, I wonder whether both satellite images fully covered the same tile or whether mosaicking was done. That could affect consistency and reduce the robustness of the comparison.\nSo, while Sentinel-2 performed better in this study, context matters. Landsat might still be more suitable in other scenarios—especially where thermal data (like LST) or historical depth is needed."

    "section": "2.3 Reflection",
    "text": "2.3 Reflection\nIt’s the first week of the term, and to be honest, it’s been a bit of a slow start. I’m still figuring out what I will take away from this course. Probable by Week 10 I will have a clearer answer. For now, I’ve got a much better grasp of the basics of remote sensing: types of sensors, surface reflectance, atmospheric interference, and how satellites and bands come into play. It’s a lot to take in, but I’m starting to connect the dots.\nSomething I’ve been thinking about is whether we can combine Landsat and Sentinel data to make better sense of climate change. Landsat has the long archive, and Sentinel gives more frequent and detailed images. Putting them together could help us spot trends over time—like, are we really seeing lasting climate change, or are we just in a long seasonal cycle that feels different but has happened before? This is a big question, especially in Europe where climate change is felt. Like snow not falling in London like how it did in previous years. Having both satellites working together might help reveal whether we’re dealing with natural variation or a real shift.\nRemote sensing, I believe will have more impact in developing countries. Ghana as a developing country could benefit from as it can monitor the land use, deforestation, and pollution. This could help in planning and decision-making. For instance, the Sentinel-5P satellite can monitor pollution levels in the atmosphere. This could be useful in Accra, where pollution levels are high.\nAlso, about SNAP—yeah, that practical was rough. Clunky interface, laggy tools, not fun. But I did get a feel for the kind of hands-on work remote sensing really involves."

This will forwarded to the partners who in this case can be Ghana Water Company, the Ghana Forestry commission and local district assemblies to check to confirm. These are key partners because the effects of illegal mining affect their works. So they can compare with their database to see if there is any correlation with incidents or irregularities. With their input which can be considered as a validation of detections, the dashboard can be created. This will then direct the taskforce on where to go. It will prorisite the locations according to the level impact for an effective. It should be made public so everyone knows the mining activities is tracked and actively tackle with transperancy.\n\n\n\nDashboard workflow\n\n\nWith an effective monitoring system, an action plan and a taskforce supplmemted by third parties, illegal mining can see as an unproductive venture. While serving as a deterrence, it aids the Government in achieving more revenue as illegal miners will turn legal miners and less money is spent on rehabilitating water bodies and forests. Implementation of this will also aid the government achieve it’s goal of sustainable and responsible mining. It also ties in with government’s aim of protecting water bodies and agricultural lands. It even goes as far as achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically goals 2, 6, 14 and 15. (Essah, 2022) Thus, reduced soil degradation of agricultural lands(SDG 2), water pollution (SDG, 6 & 14) and protect the wildlide (SDG, 15)."
