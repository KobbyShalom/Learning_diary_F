    "section": "2.1 Introduction",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nI currently understand remote sensing as the process of gathering information about the Earth’s surface without direct contact. This is done through passive sensors (like satellite imagery) and active sensors (like LiDAR and RADAR). Passive sensors detect reflected sunlight, while active ones send out pulses (e.g., lasers) and measure what bounces back. Both rely on electromagnetic waves. Remote sensing is often combined with GIS to analyse landscapes, land cover, urban areas, and environmental change. The combination of these techniques, and the data they produce, enables environmental monitoring, resource management, and biodiversity conservation at different spatial scales. Figure 1 summarizes it all.\n\n\n\nFig.1 Overview of Remote Sensing\n\n\nWhat caught my attention this week was the role of satellites—these suspended systems orbiting Earth. Remote sensing and satellites go hand-in-hand, but I hadn’t really considered the different types before. There are:\nGeostationary satellites – stationary, mainly used for weather, telecoms, and large-scale monitoring. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites – used for high-resolution imaging, orbiting 160–2,000 km above Earth. Sun-synchronous (polar) satellites – orbit Earth in sync with the sun, useful for consistent scientific observations. The sun-synchronous satellites, especially Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, stood out to me because they’re both widely used in environmental monitoring. Here’s a brief comparison:\n\n\n\nFeature\nLandsat-8\nSentinel-2\n\n\n\n\nResolution\n30m\n10-60m\n\n\nRevisit Time\n16days\n5days\n\n\nBands\n11 bands\n13 bands\n\n\n\nA term that I think will keep coming up is bands. Bands are like filters for specific wavelengths of light. Each band captures data differently, and depending on which are available, a satellite may be better suited for certain tasks. For instance, near-infrared is good for vegetation monitoring, while shortwave infrared helps with detecting soil moisture. Looking at the image here (figure 2),\n\n\n\nFig. 2 Comparison of Landsat 7 and 8 bands with Sentinel-2\n\n\nI noticed that while both satellites share some bands, they also have unique ones. For example, Landsat-8 includes a Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) which Sentinel-2 lacks—this means Landsat can provide thermal data like land surface temperature (LST), which is valuable in urban heat studies.\nUnderstanding bands will be key in selecting the right satellite for different types of studies. It’s already helping me see how technical features link to practical applications."

    "section": "2.2 Application",
    "text": "2.2 Application\nFor this section, I wanted to use what I learned in the summary to figure out which satellite is more suitable for land cover classification. A study by Ahady, A.B. and Kaplan, G. compared Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data over the city of Kabul, focusing on classification accuracy across four land cover types: water, cropland, urban, and bare land.\nKey insights\n\nLandsat-8 had an overall classification accuracy 85.04%.\nSentinel-2 had a classification accuracy of 94.26%.\n\nLet’s look at the outputs:\n\n\n\nFig. 3 Landsat-8’s imagery\n\n\n\n\n\nFig. 4 Sentinel-2 imagery\n\n\nFrom the images, it’s clear that Sentinel-2 (Figure 4) shows finer detail compared to Landsat-8 (Figure 3). One major reason could be the spatial resolution—Sentinel-2 has higher resolution, which allows it to define features more clearly, especially in urban and mixed-use areas. That likely contributes to its higher classification accuracy.\nAnother factor could be the revisit time. Sentinel-2 revisits every 5 days, while Landsat-8 takes 16 days. That means more cloud-free images are available from Sentinel-2 within the same time frame, which improves the chance of capturing clearer, more usable data.\nLastly, the spectral bands might also influence classification. As I noted earlier, bands are like filters that let satellites “see” certain land characteristics. The study used surface reflectance bands, and the near-infrared (NIR) band was especially important. For Landsat-8, that’s Band 5, and for Sentinel-2, it’s Band 8. NIR is key for separating vegetation from built-up areas, which makes it critical in land classification.\nThat said, I don’t think the study’s results mean Sentinel-2 is always better. One limitation might be the classification model used. Also, I wonder whether both satellite images fully covered the same tile or whether mosaicking was done. That could affect consistency and reduce the robustness of the comparison.\nSo, while Sentinel-2 performed better in this study, context matters. Landsat might still be more suitable in other scenarios—especially where thermal data (like LST) or historical depth is needed."

    "text": "2.3 Reflection\nIt’s the first week of the term, and to be honest, it’s been a bit of a slow start. I’m still figuring out what I will take away from this course. Probable by Week 10 I will have a clearer answer. For now, I’ve got a much better grasp of the basics of remote sensing: types of sensors, surface reflectance, atmospheric interference, and how satellites and bands come into play. It’s a lot to take in, but I’m starting to connect the dots.\nSomething I’ve been thinking about is whether we can combine Landsat and Sentinel data to make better sense of climate change. Landsat has the long archive, and Sentinel gives more frequent and detailed images. Putting them together could help us spot trends over time—like, are we really seeing lasting climate change, or are we just in a long seasonal cycle that feels different but has happened before? This is a big question, especially in Europe where climate change is felt. Like snow not falling in London like how it did in previous years. Having both satellites working together might help reveal whether we’re dealing with natural variation or a real shift.\nRemote sensing, I believe will have more impact in developing countries. Ghana as a developing country could benefit from as it can monitor the land use, deforestation, and pollution. This could help in planning and decision-making. For instance, the Sentinel-5P satellite can monitor pollution levels in the atmosphere. This could be useful in Accra, where pollution levels are high.\nAlso, about SNAP—yeah, that practical was rough. Clunky interface, laggy tools, not fun. But I did get a feel for the kind of hands-on work remote sensing really involves."

There are many sensors which can be used for this task, but I will refer to literature to recommend one or two.\n\n5.0.1 Paper 1\nIn a paper by Niroumand-Jadidi, M., Bovolo, F. and Bruzzone, L. explored the use of hyperspectral images from PRISMA sensor on retrieving water quality parameters. This was done in comparison with data collected from the sentinel -2. Just as in first chapter, I spoke about bands having an impact on the accuracy of the sensor, the comparison of bands shows PRISMA having a wide range as compared to Sentinel-2.\n\n\n\nPRISMA and Sentinel-2 Band Comparison\n\n\nIn the paper, the analysis of the images was based on the inversion of a radiative transfer model, WASI. From the results, it can be concluded that the PRISMA sensor is good for monitoring water quality. (Niroumand-Jadidi et al., 2020).\nWater quality was considered to identify mining sites because there is a high correlation between contamination of waterbodies and illegal mining activities. (Kazapoe et al., 2023).\n\n\n\nIllegal mining near a river\n\n\n\n\n5.0.2 Paper 2\nIn the second paper by (Ngom et al., 2023) they presented remote sensing techniques monitor the impact of artisanal mining. They looked at detection of sites, soil degradation, deforestation and water turbidity analysis. Not to summarize the paper, I will go into what will help with the policy. This papers, gives a idea of the scope of which EO data can be used or incorporated in and gives a workflow which I will adopt to help the policy on mining in Ghana.\n\n\n5.0.3 Workflow\nThe general approach is creating a dashboard to direct the deployment of a taskforce to inspect places which might have illegal mining going on. The dashboard will be based on a earth observation data, particularly from Sentinel-2 and PRISMA. The sentinel data will downloaded from the Copernicus server and the PRISMA data will be gathered from aerial shots of suspected areas. The PRISMA will be the main data. This will be stored.\n\n\n\nData workflow"

    "text": "4.2 Application\nWhile the exact method the anti-galamsey taskforce uses to identify illegal mining sites is unclear, Earth Observation (EO) could support smarter, evidence-based deployment. Drawing from relevant literature, I propose a data-driven approach using remote sensing tools.\n\n4.2.1 Paper 1: Water Quality Monitoring\nNiroumand-Jadidi, et al. (2020) assessed PRISMA hyperspectral imagery for retrieving water quality parameters, comparing it with Sentinel-2. PRISMA’s more spectral bands as compare to Sentinel-2. This is shown in figure 2. This was used with the WASI (Water Colour Simulator) model to detect suspended materials. Since illegal mining is closely linked with river pollution, this makes PRISMA a powerful tool for identifying active mining areas.(Kazapoe et al., 2023).\n\n\n\nFig. 2 PRISMA and Sentinel-2 Band Comparison\n\n\nWater contamination often reflects mining activity—thus tracking turbidity, sediment, and color changes can help pinpoint illegal operations. Ghana’s water bodies are regularly affected, and the PRISMA sensor’s hyperspectral capacity makes it suitable for detecting subtle environmental changes missed by standard multispectral sensors.\n\n\n\nFig. 3 Illegal mining near a river\n\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Paper 2 Wider Mining Impacts\nNgom et al. (2023) explored EO methods to monitor artisanal mining impacts like soil degradation, deforestation, and turbidity. Their framework illustrates how different indicators(e.g. water properties) can support policy enforcement through remote sensing. I will adopt their workflow to help the mining policy in Ghana.\n\n\n4.2.3 Proposed Workflow\nBuilding on both papers, I propose a monitoring dashboard using data from Sentinel-2 (temporal coverage) and PRISMA (detailed sensing). EO data would be processed to flag suspicious changes in land use or water quality. These would be cross-referenced by partners like the Ghana Water Company and Forestry Commission, providing ground validation. \n\n\n\nDashboard workflow\n\n\nA refined dashboard would prioritize locations by impact, helping the taskforce deploy more strategically. This transparency could deter offenders, support early intervention, and reduce costs associated with water treatment and ecosystem restoration.\nUltimately, this system aligns with Ghana’s sustainable mining goals, protects agricultural land and water bodies, and supports SDGs 2, 6, 14, and 15."

    "text": "4.3 Reflections\nIllegal mining does not just affect ecosystems,it directly impacts towns and people. In Ghana, water pollution from galamsey operations have led to reduced water production by the Ghana Water Company. They stated the level of pollution is to high for they machines to treats hence closing some of the water treatment plants. Residents are also exposed to heavy metals and contaminated water, which can lead to long-term health issues.\nWhat stands out is how Earth Observation (EO) could bridge the gap between policy and efficiency in policy enforcement. If implemented well, EO could help shift the response from reactive to proactive, targeting illegal operations before they cause irreversible damage.\nThe use of EO would also promote transparency—a key issue in Ghana’s mining governance. A public dashboard could build trust between citizens and government, showing that enforcement is data-driven and fair.\nFinally, there’s potential for EO to empower local agencies and communities. With proper training, district assemblies could use satellite data to guide land use decisions and involve local people in environmental protection.\nThis week showed me that remote sensing is not just about pixels and sensors—it’s a tool for environmental justice, urban resilience, and smarter governance."

    "section": "6.2 Application",
    "text": "6.2 Application\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) have been widely applied in classification tasks. I will refer to two studies that used SVM in the context of urban analysis.\nThe first study, by Zylshal et al. (2016), focused on identifying urban green spaces in Jakarta using high-resolution Pleiades-1A imagery. The classification process involved defining land cover classes—vegetation, non-vegetation, and water—followed by training the SVM model with a small dataset. Since SVM is a binary classifier, a “one-against-one” strategy was used to classify each pair of land cover types. Although the study did not state the exact input features, the data processing flowchart (figure 4) shows NDVI, NDWI and MSAVI used likely as input features, given their relevance in vegetation analysis.\n\n\n\nFig 4. Data processing flowchart\n\n\nInstead of classifying individual pixels, the study used multiresolution segmentation to group pixels into meaningful objects before applying classification. The output was further refined using expert rules and validated through an accuracy assessment, achieving 86% accuracy. This study effectively demonstrated the integration of SVM with Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) for high-resolution classification.\nThe second study, by Karimi et al. (2019), applied SVM to predict urban expansion in Guilford County, North Carolina, using data from the National Land Cover Database (USGS) and other supporting datasets. Unlike the first study’s spatial classification, this focused on temporal prediction, modeling the transition from “unbuilt” to “built” land as shown in figure 5.\n\n\n\nFig 5. Binary classification of simulated LULC map in 2016\n\n\nTo improve results, the model was tuned through kernel selection and parameter optimization. Because urban growth datasets are often imbalanced, with more unbuilt than built land, the study used strategic sampling to reduce bias. It achieved 78% accuracy, slightly lower than the first study, likely due to the larger dataset and the complexity of time-based prediction. SVM proved valuable in handling both continuous and categorical variables, making it well-suited for modeling urban growth trends.\n\n6.2.1 Insights for applications\nBoth studies applied SVM as a binary classifier, but their approaches differed. One focused on spatial classification, while the other tackled temporal change prediction. The second study likely dealt with a larger dataset, which might explain its lower accuracy, as SVM tends to perform better on smaller datasets. This raises the question of how well SVM scales for large-scale urban studies. A possible improvement would be enhancing SVM models with other machine learning techniques to handle large datasets more efficiently."

    "text": "6.3 Reflections\nThis week deepened my understanding of how Support Vector Machines (SVM) are applied in urban classification tasks. Looking at both studies helped me see the flexibility—but also the limits—of the model.\nIn the first study by Zylshal et al. (2016), the use of high-resolution imagery and indices like NDVI, NDWI, and MSAVI made sense for mapping urban green spaces in Jakarta. What stood out was the use of multiresolution segmentation—grouping pixels into meaningful objects before applying SVM. That, along with expert-based refinement, led to 86% accuracy, showing how SVM paired with Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) can be powerful in detailed, small-scale studies.\nIn contrast, the second study by Karimi et al. (2019) focused on predicting urban expansion over time in North Carolina. It used broader datasets and aimed to model how “unbuilt” land becomes “built.” The team fine-tuned the model and applied strategic sampling to handle imbalanced classes—common in urban growth studies. While it achieved 78% accuracy, the lower performance reflects the challenges of using SVM on larger, more complex datasets.\nWhat I found interesting is that both studies relied on SVM as a binary classifier, yet their outcomes varied based on scale, data volume, and focus—spatial vs. temporal. This raised an important question: how scalable is SVM for large-scale urban analysis?\nSVM works well with limited, high-quality data, but in broader applications like national urban expansion studies, it might struggle with processing speed and generalization. A key takeaway is that SVM could be enhanced by hybrid approaches, for instance, integrating it with Random Forest, neural networks, or rule-based methods for better scalability.\nOverall, this week showed me that classification is not just a technical process—it’s about tailoring tools to fit data types, goals, and scale, and SVM is just one part of a growing toolbox in urban remote sensing."

    "text": "7.1 Summary\nThis week built on last week’s classification session, but took a different turn by focusing on pre-classified datasets and sub-pixel analysis. Instead of starting from raw satellite imagery, we explored ready-to-use classification products like GlobeLand30, MODIS, and Dynamic World. These datasets allow us to work faster but raise questions about the loss of control over classification accuracy and assumptions baked into the processing.\nThe key focus for me was sub-pixel classification—a method that tries to identify multiple land cover types within a single pixel. This is really helpful when working with coarse resolution imagery where, for example, a 30m pixel might contain buildings, roads, and trees. Traditional classification would assign it one label, but sub-pixel methods estimate the proportions of each type instead.\n\n\n\nFig. 1 A zoomed-in pixel showing buildings, vegetation, and roads\n\n\nSub-pixel analysis is especially useful in urban fringe areas, where land cover is complex and mixed. But it also raises new challenges around validation and reliability. That leads us into the importance of accuracy assessment.\n\n7.1.1 Accuracy Assessment\nIn remote sensing, three key metrics help evaluate performance:\nProducer Accuracy – How well the model captures a class based on reference data \nUser Accuracy – How likely the modelled class is correct when visited on the ground\nOverall Accuracy – The total correct classifications across all classes \n\n\n\nFig. 2 Confusion matrix from Dynamic World\n\n\nLooking at Dynamic World, for instance, the model achieved 94% recall for water—meaning it detected most water pixels—but only 87% user accuracy, meaning some areas it labelled as water were not actually water on the ground. Averaging across all classes, the overall accuracy came to around 72%, which reflects the trade-off between global coverage and precision.\nThis week reinforced how classification is never just about the algorithm—it’s also about trusting the output, especially when you didn’t build it yourself."
