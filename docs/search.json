    "text": "2.1 Introduction\nThis is the first week of remote sensing module. I will first like to state a brief overview of what it entails.\n\n\n\nOverview of Remote Sensing\n\n\nRemote sensing for me is a method gathered about the Earth’s surface without direct contact through passive (e.g., satellite imagery) and active (e.g., LIDAR, RADAR) sensors. It can be integrated with GIS to analyse landscapes, land cover, demographics and others. Active sensors compute elevation using laser pulses, while passive sensors capture reflected sunlight, they all are electromagnetic waves. Combining these techniques and noting the interaction in the earth’s atmosphere, enables precise environmental monitoring, resource management, and biodiversity conservation at multiple spatial scales. Satellites I want to delve deeper into the suspend equipment above the atmosphere - Satellites. I find it interesting because when I think of remote sensing satellites come to mind. These satellites are sent up to the earth’s orbit. There are types of satellites. These are\n\nGeostationary Satellites - These are stationary satellites which are normally used for weather monitoring, telecommunications and environmental observations.\nLow Earth Orbit (LEO) Satellites: These satellites are used for high-resolution imaging has it is normally placed 160 and 2,000 km above Earth’s surface.\nSun-Synchronous (Polar) Satellites – Just like the same, these satellites orbit the earth in a polar direction and in sync with the sun. This is most used for scientific and environmental monitoring.\n\nAmong these types of satellites, I want to focus on the sun-synchronous types mainly Sentinel and Landsat satellite. Two main satellites stand out in remote sensing.\nTypes of sensors on both types\n\n\n\nFeature\nLandsat-8\nSentinel-2\n\n\n\n\nResolution\n30m\n10-60m\n\n\nRevisit Time\n16days\n5days\n\n\nBands\n11 bands\n13 bands\n\n\n\nLet’s look deeper into the bands Basically, bands are like different filters with specific wavelengths that satellites use to capture images of the earth surface. Thus, each band serves a specific purpose and for what it is best suited for. The USGS comparison graph (USGS, n.d.) illustrates how different bands on Landsat and Sentinel-2 cover different portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.\nLooking at the image here\n\n\n\nComparison of Landsat 7 and 8 bands with Sentinel-2\n\n\nIn the graph, the x axis presents the wavelength of the electromagnetic spectrum and y which shows the atmospheric transmission (%) indicates the amount of light passing through the atmosphere. The bands are important for me because I believe they tell a lot about what the data can be best used for and help in narrowing down which satellite to use in a study. Here is a summary of the bands and that use case."

    "section": "2.2 Application",
    "text": "2.2 Application\nFor this section, I want to use what I learnt in summary to understand which satellite to use for land cover classification. A study by Ahady, A.B., and Kaplan, G. shows the comparison between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data over the city of Kabul. This was a comparison over accuracy of land cover considering water, cropland, urban, and bare land.\nKey insights\nThe Landsat-8 had an overall classification accuracy 85.04%. while the Sentinel-2 had a classification accuracy of 94.26%. Now lets look at these images \n From the images we can see that Figure 2 has finer detail as compared to figure one. This may be due to several reasons, but I feel it’s mainly due to spatial resolution. The sentinel has a higher resolution, so it expected to have an influence on its accuracy, as it as able to define features more clearly. Another factor accounting for higher accuracy maybe the number of visits. The sentinel has shorter revisit period, thus more volume of data can be gathered in a month as compared to the Landsat data. Thus, a higher chance of getting an image with little interference hence a high accuracy. Lastly, I want to check the bands. This also has major effect on accuracy. As stated earlier, spectral bands are essential filters that satellites use to analyze Earth’s surface. Ahady & Kaplan’s classification relied on surface reflectance bands, which directly tie back to the band functions I described in Week 1. The near-infrared (NIR, B5 for Landsat and B8 for Sentinel-2) played a key role in differentiating urban and vegetative areas, further demonstrating the importance of understanding band selection in remote sensing applications.\nThis does not go to say we can poke holes in the results of the study. One can be model used in analysing the data. These pictures are cut clips of the same location and I’m not sure both satellites can capture the same location within a single tile. So, merging might have been done hence reducing the robustness of the result. This doesn’t go to say Landsat is better at land cover than sentinel satellite."

Ghana currently battling illegal mining being a mineral rich country. These minerals especially gold contributes a major part of the nation’s GDP. This reflects in Ghana being the 6th producer of Gold in 2024. The issue comes at a time where the prices of gold are at an all-time high.

A license granted by the Minister for Mines or an authorized officer is required for engaging in small-scale mining.

District Offices of the Commission compile a register of miners, supervise operations, provide training, and facilitate the formation of Small Scale Miners Associations.

This will forwarded to the partners who in this case can be Ghana Water Company, the Ghana Forestry commission and local district assemblies to check to confirm. These are key partners because the effects of illegal mining affect their works. So they can compare with their database to see if there is any correlation with incidents or irregularities. With their input which can be considered as a validation of detections, the dashboard can be created. This will then direct the taskforce on where to go. It will prorisite the locations according to the level impact for an effective. It should be made public so everyone knows the mining activities is tracked and actively tackle with transperancy.\n\n\n\nDashboard workflow\n\n\nWith an effective monitoring system, an action plan and a taskforce supplmemted by third parties, illegal mining can see as an unproductive venture. While serving as a deterrence, it aids the Government in achieving more revenue as illegal miners will turn legal miners and less money is spent on rehabilitating water bodies and forests. Implementation of this will also aid the government achieve it’s goal of sustainable and responsible mining. It also ties in with government’s aim of protecting water bodies and agricultural lands. It even goes as far as achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically goals 2, 6, 14 and 15. (Essah, 2022) Thus, reduced soil degradation of agricultural lands(SDG 2), water pollution (SDG, 6 & 14) and protect the wildlide (SDG, 15)."
