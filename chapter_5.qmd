## Summary

This week was all about Google Earth Engine (GEE). It’s a powerful cloud-based platform that lets you analyse satellite data without downloading huge files. Instead of running things on your laptop, GEE does the heavy lifting for you online. We looked at how it makes working with remote sensing data easier, faster, and more accessible — especially for global-scale work. The video below gives an overview of Google Earth Engine (GEE).

What really stood out for me was the shift from traditional desktop processing to cloud-based analysis. Instead of downloading loads of satellite data, cleaning it up, and then processing it on your machine, which takes forever and kills your laptop slowly, it is now done online. With GEE providing already cleaned and pre-processed data online, and with the capability to further process it to the project. This means it runs faster and doesn’t depend on your computer’s power. I think this is a big deal, especially for people in places like Ghana where cost of powerful machines can be high. GEE basically allow complex processing at faster speeds and larger volumes, inrespective of on an individual's laptop.



## Application
For this week's application, I wanted to see how GEE is used in real-world studies.
I will look a study that used it for GEE for classification analysis.

The first study is by Lodato et al (2023) who focused on the analyses of the spatiotemporal urban expansion of the Rome coastline. They used Landsat multispectral imagery from 1985 to 2020 from GEE which was used to quantified urban expansion by classification. 

GEE was used for cloud masking, creating median image composites, calculating NDVI and SwiRed indices, and implementing the Random Forest (RF) algorithm for classification. The general workflow is shown in figure 1.

The outcomes highlighted a significant increase in "Urban" and "Woodland" areas and quantified landscape transformations As shown in figure 2.

This study was carried out the analysis on GEE. This shows, GEE can process large volumes of data. However, the study also carried out the accuracy assessment on GEE. Considering how GEE does not give the user explict details on how it carries it's anaylsis, a safe guard would be to carry out the accuracy assessment on another platform to ensure the results are reliable.





## Reflection

Just like the first week, I decided to make this week's more about GEE as a product and  its applications by looking at a relevant study.

I like the idea behind Google Earth Engine. It removes a lot of  the barriers that come with remote sensing — like needing a good laptop or complicated codes for analysis. Everything’s just there and ready to use. 

Also, the way GEE simplifies code into easy functions and produces quick visuals makes me think it could even be used to teach remote sensing at the primary school level in Ghana. A lot of subjects aren't taught in detail at that level because they're seen as too complex, even though their real-world applications are discussed. So having a platform like GEE, where you can analyse and visualise data from one place with minimal technical effort, feels like a real game changer.

One thing I’m still curious about is what happens when internet access isn’t stable. Would GEE still be reliable in rural areas where the connection drops often? Also, since it’s a free platform run by a private company, what’s the long-term sustainability? These are definitely questions worth thinking about.

Overall, even though I think GEE is great for detailed analysis, I would personally prefer running some things locally, especially for sensitive or resource-heavy tasks.
