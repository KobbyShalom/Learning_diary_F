title: "Google Earth Engine"

## Summary
This week was all about Google Earth Engine (GEE). It’s a powerful cloud-based platform that lets you analyse satellite data without downloading huge files. Instead of running things on your laptop, GEE does the heavy lifting for you online. We looked at how it makes working with remote sensing data easier, faster, and more accessible — especially for global-scale work.


What really stood out for me was the shift from traditional desktop processing to cloud-based analysis. Before, you'd have to download loads of satellite data, clean it up, and then run it on your own machine — which takes forever and kills your laptop. But with GEE, the data’s already online, and the processing happens in the cloud. This means it runs faster and doesn’t depend on your computer’s power. I think this is a big deal, especially for people in places like Ghana where access to powerful machines can be limited. GEE basically opens the door for more people to do meaningful analysis, even on large datasets, without needing fancy tech setups. That feels like a huge game changer.


## Application


To understand how GEE works in practice, I looked at two studies that used it for land cover classification and change detection — both with practical use in urban planning and sustainability.

The first paper by Kamal et al. (2019) focused on monitoring land cover change in Dhaka, Bangladesh, from 1990 to 2017. They used Landsat imagery and ran a Random Forest classification through GEE. Everything from data access to processing was done in the cloud. That meant no downloading, no storage stress — just quick, consistent analysis over nearly three decades. Their output showed a massive shift from agricultural and forest areas to urban land. It was a good example of how GEE can scale analysis across time without complex infrastructure.

The second study by Jin et al. (2019) took things a step further. They built a 30-meter global land cover map using over 1 million Landsat images — all processed within GEE. They used supervised classification and trained their model using samples collected from multiple sources. What stood out was how GEE let them handle such a large dataset with relative ease. The platform allowed for global-scale mapping, which would’ve been nearly impossible using local machines.

Both studies showed how GEE makes remote sensing more accessible, especially for researchers and policymakers in the Global South. It reduces technical barriers and speeds up workflows without sacrificing accuracy. I can definitely see how this could be used for urban planning in Ghana — tracking informal settlements, land-use conflicts, or even flood zones over time.





## Reflection

Honestly, I really like the idea behind Google Earth Engine. It removes a lot of the barriers that come with remote sensing — like needing a high-spec laptop or dealing with slow downloads. Everything’s just there and ready to use. I can definitely see how this could be super useful in Ghana, especially for government agencies or local researchers who may not have access to powerful machines but still want to monitor things like illegal mining, urban sprawl, or deforestation.

What surprised me was how quick the results came through. With just a bit of JavaScript, you can visualise changes over time or run NDVI analysis in seconds. I’m still getting used to the coding part, but it feels way more approachable than I expected.

One thing I’m still wondering about, though, is what happens when internet access isn’t stable. Like, would this be fully reliable in rural areas where connections drop often? And also, what’s the long-term sustainability of using a free cloud service run by a private company? Those are things I’d want to look into more.

But overall, this week made me feel like big, global-scale analysis is no longer just for people with big funding or expensive hardware. That’s a win.
