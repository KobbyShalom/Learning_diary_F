## Preface 

This is a diary showing my progress, understanding, and interests in remote sensing. My background in civil engineering, green/sustainable development (as an EDGE expert), and sound engineering might influence how I reflect on the content and what stands out to me.

As a Ghanaian, I’m also interested in how remote sensing methods and sensors apply across both developing and developed countries. I will likely reflect on how universal or adaptable these approaches really are.

Where possible, I will also consider some economic or financial implications of some methods or strategies discussed each week—especially in terms of how feasible they are in different contexts.

Overall, my reflections will focus on remote sensing will focus on the anaylsis and thoughts that come to mind as write the summary and application sections.
