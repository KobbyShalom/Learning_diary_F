## Summary

This is the last week for the learning dairy, and we wrapped up the module with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). This was a shift from the passive sensors, like optical sensors, to active sensors unlike in the previous sessions. I will focus on SAR for this week and try to understand board scope of it as is still new to me.

### SAR Background

As an active sensor, it produces its own energy in a form of microwave pulses to and records the reflected pulses (called backscatter) to generate images. The use of microwave signals in SAR allows it to penetrate thin objects easily. This is particularly relevant in remote sensing as it reduces the chances of interference by clouds in the data. Also, the SAR not dependant on sunlight thus, can operate day and night.

### How SAR Works

SAR sensor analyses the backscatter signals to create the images. The strength and phase of these backscatter signals provide information about surface texture, roughness, and material composition. The key advantage is that SAR synthesizes a large virtual aperture by moving along its flight path, which allows it to achieve high-resolution imaging.

### Data from SAR

SAR data is primarily in the form of backscatter intensity and texture information, which is highly dependent on resolution.

-   Low-resolution SAR produces a coarse texture, suitable for large-scale land cover mapping.

-   High-resolution SAR reveals fine surface details, useful for urban infrastructure and detailed terrain analysis.

Resolution is also influenced by the antenna length—a longer antenna results in better resolution hence the essence of the Synthetic Aperture.

### Key Applications of SAR

There are two major techniques in geospatial applications: - InSAR (Interferometric SAR): Used for generating Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) by converting phase differences into relative height measurements. - DInSAR (Differential InSAR): Detects ground movement (uplift or subsidence) by comparing SAR images over time, with topographic influences removed using a DEM.

### Limitations and possible future developments.

One major challenge with SAR is the complex preprocessing required to make the data usable. Steps like orbit correction, radiometric calibration, de-bursting, multilooking, speckle filtering, and terrain correction are tedious but necessary. Based on my experience with data wrangling in CASA005, preprocessing often leads to some data loss, which is a concern for analysis accuracy. In the future, improved automated SAR processing pipelines could help streamline this workflow and make SAR data more accessible for everyday users.

## Application

This week, I wanted to look at a more hands-on use of SAR — detecting and tracking ships on water.

The first study by Ouchi (2016) explores how SAR is used for ship detection and classification. everal methods were tested, but CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate) stood out for its simplicity and effectiveness. CFAR is a statistical method that sets a threshold based on background noise, allowing it to detect ships even in cluttered environments.

The author also discussed different SAR modes, which affect how much area is captured and at what resolution:

-   Stripmap Mode: High resolution, but narrow swath.

-   ScanSAR Mode: Lower resolution, but covers a wider area.

-   Single-Polarization SAR: Sends and receives in one direction (e.g., HH or VV).

-   Fully Polarimetric SAR: Uses multiple polarizations (HH, HV, VH, VV), giving richer data for separating ships from sea clutter.

HV provides the strongest ship-to-background contrast.

The second study by Yasir et al. (2024) demonstrated ship detection using Gaofen-3 SAR imagery (1m resolution) with a YOLOv8 model for detection and a C-BIOU tracker for following ships over time.

The second study by Yasir et al. (2024) demonstrated ship detection using Gaofen-3 SAR imagery (1m resolution) with a YOLOv8 model for detection and a C-BIOU tracker for following ships over time.

The whole model is built around SAR data, probably because SAR can see through clouds and works both day and night, which is a big deal at sea. One downside is they used Gaofen-3, and that data isn’t easy to get—it’s not public, so unless you have access, it might be hard to try the same thing. Still, the study really shows how powerful SAR can be for spotting and tracking ships, even in tricky conditions.

### Key insights

Both papers show SAR is highly effective for ship detection. However, there’s always a trade-off between resolution, polarization, and coverage. Choosing the right SAR setup depends on the goal—whether it’s wide surveillance or detailed tracking in coastal zones.

## Reflection

This is the last week of the learning diary. I chose vessel detection as my focus because many major cities are built along the coast, and with the rise in personal boat ownership, there’s a growing need for better monitoring of maritime activity—from small crafts to large vessels.

While going through the SAR-based detection studies, I found myself wondering: if SAR mainly detects surface texture, how does it spot ships during rough sea or stormy conditions? Does the radar band slightly penetrate the water or is the ship’s location just inferred from a prediction model using previous data?

From the papers, it seems SAR can still detect ships directly—even under challenging conditions—and weather wasn’t really mentioned as a limitation. This suggests that the choice of wavelength or band plays a big role in how well SAR handles stormy seas. It also shows how deep learning paired with SAR is helping reduce those limitations, making ship detection more accurate and real-time.

To wrap it up, this week showed me that SAR isn’t just useful but its impact is great when applied well. And in a world where coastal cities are expanding fast, having tools like this could make a real difference in monitoring, security, and sustainability at sea.
