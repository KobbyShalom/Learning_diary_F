# Summary

### Introduction

The system in Ghana is a unique system where policies are mainly created by the central government. The implementation of the policy is through the ministries. The mainly create taskforces with the police to enforce it.

### Background

For this week, I want to look at the illegal mining commonly known as Galamsey. Ghana currently battling illegal mining being a mineral rich country. These minerals especially gold contributes a major part of the nation’s GDP. This reflects in Ghana being the 6th producer of Gold in 2024. The issue comes at a time where the prices of gold are at an all-time high. (Savage et al., 2025) This is shown in the graph below.

Even though there are policies regulating mining activities, the country faces the impacts of galamsey. This is evident in the Ghana water company

### Policy

In Ghana, the Minerals and Mining Act 703 addresses small-scale mining specifically in sections 82 to 99. A license granted by the Minister for Mines or an authorized officer is required for engaging in small-scale mining. To qualify, an applicant must be a Ghanaian citizen at least eighteen years old and registered by the Commission.

The Minister may designate areas for small-scale mining in the Gazette. District Offices of the Commission compile a register of miners, supervise operations, provide training, and facilitate the formation of Small Scale Miners Associations. Small Scale Mining Committees in designated areas assist the District Office in monitoring and promoting mining operations. Licensees must employ effective mining methods, observe safety rules, and protect the environment.

### Insights

The policy does state how ministry and their district offices monitor the illegal mining. However, the rise in illegal activities and destruction of water bodies and land shows a gap of ineffectiveness. There are some other parties involved in monitoring the mining activities such as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).(Kazapoe et al., 2023)

The government established an anti-galamsey task force code named Operation Halt was formed to crackdown on illegal mining activities.(“Anti-galamsey task force destroys 10 Changfans other mining equipment on Pra River,” 2024) Even though the taskforce was formed in October 2024, the illegal mining still persist with four civil society organizations calling for leadership changes.(“Anti-galamsey task force destroys 10 Changfans other mining equipment on Pra River,” 2024; “Illegal mining menace,” 2025)

# Application

The current method used by the taskforce to identify and deploy people to the sites is unknown, but I believe earth observation (EO) can be used to improve the effectiveness of the taskforce. There are many sensors which can be used for this task, but I will refer to literature to recommend one or two.

### Paper 1

In a paper by Niroumand-Jadidi, M., Bovolo, F. and Bruzzone, L. explored the use of hyperspectral images from PRISMA sensor on retrieving water quality parameters. This was done in comparison with data collected from the sentinel -2. Just as in first chapter, I spoke about bands having an impact on the accuracy of the sensor, the comparison of bands shows PRISMA having a wide range as compared to Sentinel-2.

In the paper, the analysis of the images was based on the inversion of a radiative transfer model, WASI. From the results, it can be concluded that the PRISMA sensor is good for monitoring water quality. (Niroumand-Jadidi et al., 2020).

Water quality was considered to identify mining sites because there is a high correlation between contamination of waterbodies and illegal mining activities. (Kazapoe et al., 2023).

### Paper 2

In the second paper by (Ngom et al., 2023) they presented remote sensing techniques monitor the impact of artisanal mining. They looked at detection of sites, soil degradation, deforestation and water turbidity analysis. Not to summarize the paper, I will go into what will help with the policy. This papers, gives a idea of the scope of which EO data can be used or incorporated in and gives a workflow which I will adopt to help the policy on mining in Ghana.

### Workflow

The general approach is creating a dashboard to direct the deployment of a taskforce to inspect places which might have illegal mining going on. The dashboard will be based on a earth observation data, particularly from Sentinel-2 and PRISMA. The sentinel data will downloaded from the Copernicus server and the PRISMA data will be gathered from aerial shots of suspected areas. The PRISMA will be the main data. This will be stored.
